## Exercise 1: CLI Quiz Game

This exercise is based on Exercise #1: Quiz Game on the [gophercises website](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz).

This is a simple quiz game that reads questions and answers from a CSV file, then, in the terminal, asks the user to answer them. The game keeps track of the number of correct answers and prints the final score at the end.
